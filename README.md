# üöó Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) ‚Äì Graduation Project 2025

An integrated, multi-module ADAS platform developed as part of our graduation project at Alexandria University. The system combines embedded systems, AI, computer vision, and real-time control to implement key safety features found in modern autonomous vehicles.

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully functional **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)** prototype, featuring:

- **Blind Spot Detection (BSD)**
- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**
- **Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)**
- **Automatic Parking (Parallel & Perpendicular)**
- **Autonomous Lane Change & Lane Keeping**
- **Driver Drowsiness Detection (DDD)**

All modules are deployed on a two-tier embedded platform: **STM32F401** for real-time control tasks and **Raspberry Pi 5** for AI-driven perception systems.

## üéØ Objectives

- Increase road safety by automating driver support tasks.
- Design a real-time embedded control system with multiple sensors and communication protocols.
- Integrate AI and computer vision models for driver monitoring and scene understanding.
- Create a mobile, testable platform inspired by the **Tesla Cybertruck** design.
